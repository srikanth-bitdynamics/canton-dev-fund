## Abstract

This proposal requests funding for an open-source reference implementation, in Daml and TypeScript, for orchestrating cross-domain Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP) settlement across independent Canton synchronizer domains.

Canton already provides reassignment and the primitives needed for cross-domain movement. What is still missing for most application teams is the application-layer settlement infrastructure: locking semantics, bilateral settlement intent, orchestration state, timeout handling, restart behavior, and recovery boundaries.

CCDS will provide a reusable reference pattern rather than a hosted product or universal settlement platform. The deliverables include:

- a Daml settlement-capable locking interface and canonical settlement instruction
- a TypeScript orchestrator for `lock -> unassign -> assign -> execute -> return`
- persisted checkpoints, restart recovery, and documented pre/post-commit behavior
- a bounded reference suite of asset paths, including local `Lockable` assets, CIP-0056 / Daml Finance-style adapter paths, Splice / `HoldingV1` / `Amulet` style paths, and a bridge-backed Canton Coin / DA Utility reference flow
- a minimal reference app, reviewer-friendly demos, and integration documentation

The goal is to lower the cost of building cross-domain DvP on Canton by giving the ecosystem an open reference implementation that teams can evaluate, adopt, and extend.

---

## Specification

### 1. Objective

The objective is to reduce the application-layer friction of cross-domain settlement in Canton by publishing a concrete reference implementation that other teams can run, study, and adapt.

The intended outcome is that a Canton team can:

- lock a settlement leg on one synchronizer
- reassign both legs to a neutral settlement synchronizer
- execute the DvP swap in one settlement-domain transaction
- handle documented pre-commit abort cases safely
- complete documented post-commit forward recovery after interruptions

The project is explicitly positioned as ecosystem infrastructure and a reference implementation, not a universal standard, hosted operator, or production settlement product.

### 2. Implementation Mechanics

The project will be delivered as:

- a Daml package for settlement-capable locking and release semantics
- a TypeScript orchestration library for cross-domain settlement state transitions
- checkpoint persistence and recovery logic for interrupted flows
- bridge helpers for the included Canton Coin / DA Utility reference flow
- a minimal reference DvP app, demo scripts, and technical documentation

The reference topology uses a Neutral Settlement Domain pattern with three synchronizers:

- home synchronizer A for the first leg
- home synchronizer B for the counter-leg
- one mutually trusted neutral settlement synchronizer for atomic DvP execution

The implementation will make bilateral settlement intent explicit through a canonical instruction object. That instruction records, at minimum:

- the two counterparties
- the neutral settlement synchronizer identifier
- the locked asset references for both legs
- a unique settlement identifier
- timeout and abort data
- the current settlement state used by the orchestrator

The orchestrator runs on participant-controlled infrastructure and has deliberately narrow authority:

- it can act only on already-authorized bilateral settlement intent
- it may drive only the next allowed transition recorded in the instruction and checkpoint state
- neutral-domain execution remains gated by the Daml settlement transaction
- pre-execution timeouts may abort only the documented rollback-safe cases
- after execution commits, recovery switches to forward recovery rather than pretending the original state can always be restored

At a high level, CCDS works by having each counterparty lock its settlement leg on its home synchronizer, then reassign those locked legs to a mutually trusted neutral settlement synchronizer. Once both legs are present there, CCDS executes a single Daml settlement transaction against the bilateral instruction, which atomically swaps the two locked positions. The participant-side orchestrator does not decide settlement terms on its own: it only advances the next permitted step of an already-authorized instruction and persists checkpoints so interrupted flows can either unwind documented pre-commit cases or complete documented post-commit forward recovery.

The reference asset scope is intentionally bounded to a small set of representative paths:

- a local reference `Lockable` asset path
- CIP-0056 compliant token paths represented through a reference adapter pattern
- a Daml Finance-style holding adapter path
- a Splice / `HoldingV1` / `Amulet` style adapter path, including a bridge-backed Canton Coin reference flow

In CCDS, CIP-0056 is used at the asset-adapter boundary rather than by changing the settlement protocol itself: a CIP-0056-style holding is represented through a settlement-capable adapter, and the orchestrator then treats it like any other `Lockable` settlement leg.

Where CCDS includes adapter paths, it is proving the integration pattern and coordinator behavior. It does not promise direct drop-in compatibility with every deployed external package line. Broader package-specific direct integrations outside the included reference paths are future work and may be proposed separately after the reference implementation has been evaluated in the ecosystem.

Out of scope for this grant:

- legacy connectivity such as SWIFT, SEPA, or bank APIs
- bespoke adapters for proprietary institutional platforms
- broad multi-asset adapter coverage beyond the included reference paths
- frontend dashboard products beyond a minimal reference app
- formal standardization or CIP authorship work
- direct drop-in integration with every external Daml Finance package line
- speculative third-party audit funding

If evaluation or implementation findings show that a later milestone requires materially different effort than expected, the team may return to the Committee with a scoped amendment request rather than silently broadening scope.

### 3. Architectural Alignment

This proposal aligns with Canton’s Network of Networks model because it addresses a coordination problem created by domain fragmentation at the application layer rather than requiring protocol changes.

It is aligned with Development Fund priorities because it delivers:

- a reusable cross-domain settlement reference pattern
- shared infrastructure for DvP-oriented application developers
- a concrete implementation path on top of Canton reassignment primitives
- a public-good foundation for future DvP and PvP tooling

The included reference suite is intentionally limited to representative paths that make the pattern concrete while still keeping CCDS within reference-implementation scope.

### 4. Backward Compatibility

*No backward compatibility impact.*

This project is additive. It introduces a new reference implementation and supporting client library without requiring protocol changes or changes to existing Canton core behavior.

### Team Background
BitDynamics brings deep experience in building and operating blockchain infrastructure. The team has worked across Ethereum client infrastructure, validator operations, and production-grade hosting systems supporting validator infrastructure securing more than 2 billion AUD in assets. This background is directly relevant to building reliable, auditable, and security-conscious public infrastructure for a grants program. Team is also building actively on Canton.

## Potential Ecosystem Beneficiaries

This proposal is intended as public-good infrastructure for the wider Canton ecosystem. A few ecosystem teams appear well aligned with this feature set and with the kinds of problems CCDS is designed to address, including Gateway, Lumens.fi, and Hashrupt.

These capabilities target recurring orchestration and recovery pain points that teams in this category face when building or operating Canton-based systems, especially where delivery-versus-payment or asset movement must span multiple synchronizer domains.

More broadly, the project is intended to benefit teams building cross-domain settlement workflows, multi-synchronizer financial applications, and reusable post-trade coordination patterns on Canton.

## Adoption and Reuse Boundary

Adoption is intended to be straightforward but explicit about the reuse boundary. Teams can reuse the TypeScript orchestrator, recovery logic, and utility bridge helpers directly, while adapting their own asset model on the Daml side by implementing the `Lockable` interface in a thin package-local adapter. In that sense, CCDS is designed to be reused partly as library code and partly as a reference blueprint, which reflects how Daml application reuse typically works in practice.

## Co-Marketing

Upon release, the implementing entity will collaborate with the Foundation on:

- Announcement coordination  
- Case study or technical blog  
- Developer or ecosystem promotion  

Specific commitments:

- publish integration guidance for teams evaluating the reference pattern
- publish at least one developer-facing walkthrough or demo
- publish at least one end-to-end example showing the reference DvP flow

---

## Motivation

Canton’s value proposition is not only privacy or institutional messaging. It is the ability to support coordination across independently operated domains.

But if each application team must build cross-domain settlement orchestration from scratch, the network-of-networks model remains unnecessarily expensive to use in practice.

A reusable reference implementation for cross-domain DvP settlement would give the ecosystem:

- a common starting point for inter-domain asset exchange
- safer and more consistent reassignment handling
- a concrete recovery model for interrupted settlement flows
- lower engineering cost for future Canton applications dealing with fragmented domain liquidity
- a practical reference suite that external teams can evaluate before building bespoke integrations

This makes CCDS a strong candidate for Development Fund support as reusable open-source ecosystem infrastructure.

---

## Rationale

This proposal is intentionally scoped as a reference implementation rather than a universal settlement standard.

That is the right approach because:

- cross-domain settlement is operationally complex, so the first public-good deliverable should prove a small but useful set of reference paths well
- the ecosystem benefits more from a reusable open-source handshake and recovery pattern than from a broad but weakly verified platform claim
- adoption depends as much on reviewability, demos, and recovery clarity as on the happy-path code itself
- keeping the initial implementation bounded avoids overlap with broader SDK, dApp API, and institutional product proposals

The `2.1M CC` request prices CCDS as a reusable public reference implementation with documentation, recovery behavior, and evaluation milestones, rather than as a one-off proprietary integration or a universal settlement platform.
